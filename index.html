                Welcome, my name is Cody Saal. I am currently a high school physics and math teacher in Racine Wisconsin. This is my seventh year as a teacher. Over those seven years I have discovered that the reason I fell into education was because of my love of learning. I actually enjoy being the student more than the teacher.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that said, I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp where I hope to develop the skills to make a career change into the tech field. This portfolio currently acts as a sandbox for me to test out new skills. As you can see, I am on the beginning of my programming journey but I am excited for what lies ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                My physics and math background has helped me tremendously so far in the bootcamp. The critical thinking and problem solving skills that I have developed within these two subjects has carried right over to programming. I thoroughly enjoy getting stuck on a problem and being left on my own to experiment and research to find the answer.
            </p>
